<h4 class="center">An Ordinance Related to the Amendment of the Zoning Ordinance and Subdivision &amp; Development Regulations to include standards for adult oriented uses</h4>
<p><strong>WHEREAS:</strong> The existing <em>Zoning Ordinance and Subdivision &amp; Development Regulations</em> do not have a provision for Adult Oriented Uses and Entertainment.

<p><strong>WHEREAS:</strong> KRS 82.088 (1) authorizes the City to "regulate the location of adult establishments by dispersing them throughout the city or by concentrating them in one (1) area. This regulation is intended to "prevent crime, protect the city’s retail trade, maintain property values, and generally to protect and preserve the quality of its neighborhoods, commercial districts and the quality of urban life.";</p>

</ol>
</li>
	<li>A new section of the ZONING ORDINANCE, ARTICLE II, Section 2.55, Adult Oriented Uses, is created as follows: with the following performance standards,
<ol class="decimal">
	<li><u>Purpose This Ordinance</u>: The purpose of this section is to establish appropriate requirements under which adult oriented uses may locate within the City of Georgetown and Scott County. It has been demonstrated statistically through verifiable studies in numerous communities that adult oriented uses have harmful secondary effects on the communities in which they locate, particularly when near residential or other areas in which residential, educational, religious and/or recreational uses are permitted.</li>
	<li><u>Findings Upon Which This Ordinance Is Based</u>: The harmful secondary effects which adult oriented uses have on communities in which they locate include inappropriate exposure of children and teenagers to graphic sexual images, increased incidence in crime, diminished property values, discouragement of other types of commercial activities, discouragement of residential, educational, religious and recreational uses, hereafter referred to as protected uses. The cumulative effect of the location of adult oriented uses, especially in concentration, is a change in the perceived community character and the diminishment of the quality of life or business for the other uses in the neighborhood in which the adult oriented uses are located. Regulation of adult oriented uses is necessary to reduce the secondary harmful effects of these uses, including, but not limited to, the decline of community health and safety and the blighting of surrounding neighborhoods and uses. Regulation of adult oriented uses is also necessary for the integrity of residential areas, schools, churches or other places of worship, libraries, child care centers, parks and playgrounds, all of which are areas in which minors congregate, a segment of the community particularly at risk when in proximity to adult oriented uses.</li>
	<li><u>Exclusions From Operation of This Ordinance</u>: Excluded from this Ordinance are activities which are not for the purpose of sexual stimulation or gratification, including but, not limited to the following: Licensed Massage Therapist, as defined in this Ordinance; other persons engaged in massage, e.g. sports massage administered by a team trainer; and artistic studios, photographic or otherwise, utilizing the nude body as a model.</li>
	<li><u>Permitted Districts</u>: Adult oriented uses are permitted in B-2, Highway Commercial, and I-1, Light Industry, subject to the general provisions of the Zoning Ordinance and Subdivision &amp; Development Regulations.</li>
	<li><u>Locational Standards</u>:
<ol class="lower-alpha">
	<li><u>Distance from residential use</u>: No lot occupied, or to be occupied, by an adult oriented use shall be located closer than a one thousand (1,000) feet radius of any residential zoning district.</li>
	<li><u>Distance from educational, religious and child related use</u>: No lot occupied, or to be occupied, by an adult oriented use shall be located closer than a one thousand (1,000) feet radius of any school, public or private, college, university, church or other place of worship, library, type I day care facility, or any public park or playground.</li>
	<li><u>Distance from agricultural residential use</u>: No lot occupied, or to be occupied, by an adult oriented use shall be located closer than a one thousand (1,000) feet radius of any agricultural zoning district developed or designated for residential purposes, including cluster residential subdivisions or three (3) or more residential tracts as shown on an approved and recorded subdivision plat.</li>

	<li><u>Method of measurement of distances</u>: The distances required by this section shall be measured from the closest property line occupied, or to be occupied, by an adult oriented use to the closest property line occupied by a protected use, zone district in which an adult oriented use is not permitted, or another adult oriented use.</li>
	<li><u>Landscape requirements</u>: All newly constructed or renovated structures that are used for, or proposed for use as, adult oriented uses shall meet the landscaping requirements set out in the Georgetown/Scott County Landscape and Land Use Buffers Ordinance, including the property perimeter requirements otherwise required in Article 6.12, Section A.2.</li>
	<li><u>Effect of establishment of protected use</u>: The establishment of any protected use, zone district in which an adult oriented use is not permitted, or another adult oriented use, subsequent to the lawful commencement of an adult oriented use shall not render the adult oriented use non-conforming.</li>
	<li><u>Amortization of existing adult oriented uses</u>: An existing adult oriented use established prior to the passage of this ordinance shall be deemed a non-conforming use for a period of two years or for the remaining term of the adult oriented use’s lease which is in force at the time of the effective date of this Ordinance, whichever occurs first. For the purpose of this provision, the term of the adult oriented use’s lease shall not include extensions. At the expiration of the period established in this subsection, the existing adult oriented use established prior to the passage of this ordinance shall comply with the requirements of this Ordinance.</li>
	<li><u>Extension of time for the amortization of existing adult oriented uses</u>: Applications for an extension of the time for compliance established by Section One, B., h., above, may be granted for good cause shown and must be received by the Office of the Building Inspector, with copy to the Planning Commission Office, not less than 90 days prior to the termination date.

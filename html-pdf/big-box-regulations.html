    <li><strong>Introduction</strong>
        <ul class="none">
            <li>A growing trend in communities across the country is the development of large retail, or "big-box", design standards. The cities of Fort Collins, Colorado, Tucson, Arizona, Easton, Maryland, and Somerset County, New Jersey have already implemented design standards for large retail establishments. Lexington is currently in the process of adopting design standards.
<br /><br />
"Big-box" retail can be defined as large-scale retailers, such as Wal-Mart, Kmart, Meijer, Kroger, Target, Circuit City, or Home Depot, that occupy more than 50,000 square feet and derive their profits from high sales volumes. They may operate as stand-alone facilities, or more commonly they are located in a "power center."
<br /><br />
Power centers will usually have some common characteristic such as large rectangular single-story structures, a reliance on auto-borne traffic with large areas of parking, limited mass transit service, and a no frills site plan with little unique community character, mixed-use and pedestrian amenities. Power centers will generally bring together various branches of the "big-box" family, for example, a discount department store, a warehouse club, a supermarket, and smaller outlots.
<br /><br />
Examples of power centers in Lexington include Hamburg Place, Beaumont Center, and the new Lowe’s/Wal-Mart on Nicholasville Road. In Georgetown, Washington Square, Georgetown Center, and Factory Stores of America could be considered examples of power centers. Although these three sites are much smaller in scale, they all contain "big-boxes" in excess of 50,000 square feet (Kroger with approximately 60,000 sq. ft. and Kmart with approximately 96,000 sq. ft., Factory Stores of America contain a total of 176,000 sq. ft.). The three sites also contain retail establishments with less than 50,000 square feet. The recently approved rezoning of Cherry Blossom Properties (A-1 Agricultural to B-5 General Commercial Park), located between I-75 and 84 Lumber, is designed to be a power center as defined above. The approved conceptual plan shows the site with a "big-box" structure and numerous outlots with a large parking area. The Howard Property, recently rezoned from A-1 to B-5, contains 27.31 acres that is suitable for a "big-box" type of development. Also, the Whitaker Property (225 acres), located north of 84 Lumber and south of Toyota, was recently rezoned from A-1 to B-5. Although this site is proposed for a mixed use of commercial, professional office, limited light industrial, and residential, there is approximately 43 acres suitable for "big-box" development. The site was approved with the Traditional Neighborhood Design in mind, thus the need exists for design standards to be in place it ensure the entire development is coordinated for an overall community design.
<br /><br />
The B-5 zone is designed to allow flexibility in the development of compatible mixed-use areas of limited light industrial, professional office, and commercial in a business park or "campus-style" setting. The B-5 zone discourages "strip" commercial development while encouraging internal driveways and pedestrian access in order to minimize traffic movements out of the development. The B-5 is designed to minimize off-site impacts generally associated with standard commercial/B-2 development with increased setbacks and landscape buffers. The B-5 includes higher design standards but does not typically or specifically address "big-box" concerns. As "big-box" development could occur in B-2, B-4, and B-5, these guidelines shall be utilized in any district where "big-box" development may locate.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Background and Justification</strong>
        <ul class="none">
            <li>The basis for development within our community is set forth in the Zoning Ordinance, Subdivision Regulations, and the Comprehensive Plan. Article I, Section 1.3 of the Zoning Ordinance for Georgetown, Scott County, Sadieville, and Stamping Ground states, "The purpose of the Zoning Ordinance is to promote the general welfare by establishing and regulating zoning districts… In establishing the zoning districts, this ordinance seeks the general welfare by designating sufficient space for all necessary uses of land, by protecting the permitted uses in each district from the undesirable effects of conflicting uses, and by ensuring the stable value of all permitted development." Article I, Section 105 of the Subdivision &amp; Development Regulations for Georgetown, Scott County, Sadieville, and Stamping Ground states, "These regulations are adopted in order to implement the Georgetown-Scott County Comprehensive Plan and to ensure the protection of public health, safety, and welfare." Furthermore, Section I, Subsection B-3 of the Georgetown-Scott County Comprehensive Plan 1996 Update states, "Community identity and integrity should be maintained as we grow, and opportunities for community social life should be increased." Subsection B-4 goes on to state, "Scott County cities should maintain their small town character…"
<br /><br />
With the tremendous amount of growth occurring in Georgetown and Scott County, it is a matter of time before large retail establishments begin locating in our community and the possibility of existing establishments relocating or expanding. Large retail establishments will locate anywhere, be it a rural town, suburban county, or an urban center. Within a 25 mile radius of Georgetown, there are 7 Wal-Marts (2 superstores) and 7 Kmarts (according to Wal-Mart and Kmart internet store locators).
<br /><br />
The residents of Georgetown and Scott County are largely defined by small town characteristics and quality of life. As a community, we should not only be concerned about the economic impact of big-box retailers on our traditional downtown merchants but also on how the appearance of such retail establishments fit in with the community.
<br /><br />
Our community does not have to rely on the dull, rectangular boxes of retail giants, with massive amounts of asphalt and limited landscaping and pedestrian amenities.
<br /><br />
A growing number of jurisdictions are requiring a much higher level of design standards and implementing procedures that require large retail stores to better relate to the characteristics of the community.
<br /><br />
In Fort Collins, CO., there were many public hearings with the community playing a large role in defining the retail standards, and it resulted in a nationally acclaimed ordinance. Staff has reviewed this ordinance and an ordinance adopted by Tucson, AZ. Also, staff has contacted the planning departments in Rockville, MD, Easton, MD, Somerset County, NJ, and Lexington, KY, who are in the process of writing their ordinances. The research indicates that Fort Collins has become the model that communities are basing their design standards and ordinances on.
<br /><br />
These proposed guidelines are a response to dissatisfaction with corporate chain marketing strategy, dictating design that is indifferent to local identity and interests. The main goal is to encourage development that contributes to Georgetown-Scott County as a unique place by reflecting its physical character and adding to it in appropriate ways. Large retail developments depend on high visibility from major public streets. In turn, their design determines much of the character and attractiveness of major streetscapes in the city. The marketing interests of many corporations, even strong image-making design by professional designers, can be potentially detrimental to community aspirations and sense of place when they result in massive individual developments that do not contribute to or integrate with the community in a positive way.
<br /><br />
The purpose of these guidelines is to augment the existing criteria contained in the B-5 General Commercial Park and those contained in the Zoning Ordinance and Subdivision Regulations, with more specific interpretations that apply to the design of large retail developments. These guidelines require a basic level of architectural variety, compatible scale, pedestrian and bicycle access, and mitigation of negative impacts.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Procedure</strong>
        <ul class="none">
            <li>The following guidelines are intended to be used as a design aid by developers proposing large retail developments and as an evaluation tool by the staff of the Planning Commission in their review processes. These guidelines shall apply to all projects, which are processed according to the criteria for proposed development plans and to all projects for retail establishments of more than 50,000 square feet. These guidelines are to be used in conjunction with the Subdivision &amp; Development Regulations.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Definitions</strong>
        <dl>
            <dd><strong>Arcade</strong></dd>
            <dt>an area contiguous to a street or plaza that is open and unobstructed, and that is accessible to the public at all times. Arcades may include building columns, landscaping, statuary and fountains. Arcades do not include off-street loading/unloading areas, driveways or parking areas.<hr /></dt>
            <dd><strong>Articulate</strong></dd>
            <dt>to give emphasis to or distinctly identify a particular element. An articulated façade would be the emphasis of elements on the face of a wall including a change in setback, materials, roof pitch or height.<hr /></dt>
            <dd><strong>"As-of-Right Zoning"</strong></dd>
            <dt>uses and development standards that are determined in advance and specifically authorized by the zoning regulations (e.g., a single-family zone would allow single-family housing as of right so long as site development standards are met). This type of zoning is in contrast to cumulative or "pyramidal" zoning.<hr /></dt>
            <dd><strong>Berm</strong></dd>
            <dt>an earthen mound designed to provide visual interest on a site, screen undesirable views, reduce noise or provide a buffer from adjoining uses.<hr /></dt>
            <dd><strong>Breezeway</strong></dd>
            <dt>a structure for the principal purpose of connecting a main building or structure on a property with other buildings.<hr /></dt>
            <dd><strong>Buffer</strong></dd>
            <dt>see also "screen". An area provided to reduce the conflict between two different land uses. Buffers are intended to mitigate undesired views, noise and glare - effectively providing greater privacy to neighboring land uses. Typical buffers consist of materials that serve this purpose and include, but are not limited to, plant materials, walls, fences and/or significant land area to separate the uses.<hr /></dt>
            <dd><strong>Buffer Strip</strong></dd>
            <dt>a portion of a lot or property used to visually separate one use from another through the use of vegetation, distance or other approved method.<hr /></dt>
            <dd><strong>Building Face, Front</strong></dd>
            <dt>any building face, which can be touched by a line drawn perpendicular to street (public or private).<hr /></dt>
            <dd><strong>Building Face, Public</strong></dd>
            <dt>any building side which is visible from public or private right-of-ways and/or the faces that contain public entry.<hr /></dt>
            <dd><strong>Building Mass</strong></dd>
            <dt>the building’s expanse or bulk and is typically used in reference to structures of considerable size.<hr /></dt>
            <dd><strong>Design Guidelines</strong></dd>
            <dt>statements and graphics intended to direct the planning and development of the built environment in a particular manner or style so that the end result contributes positively to the overall development.<hr /></dt>
            <dd><strong>Dormer</strong></dd>
            <dt>a window set vertically in a gable projecting from a sloping roof.<hr /></dt>
            <dd><strong>Facade</strong></dd>
            <dt>the portion of any exterior elevation on the building extending from grade to the top of the parapet, wall or eaves and extending the entire length of the building.<hr /></dt>
            <dd><strong>Front Yard</strong></dd>
            <dt>the portion of the front yard extending the full width of the lot and measured between the front lot line and a parallel line across the front of the building. Corner and double lots shall adhere to the front yard setback(s) for each frontage.<hr /></dt>
            <dd><strong>Gable</strong></dd>
            <dt>a triangular wall section at the end of a pitched roof, bounded by the two roof slopes.<hr /></dt>
            <dd><strong>Hip Roof</strong></dd>
            <dt>roof without gables.<hr /></dt>
            <dd><strong>Parapet</strong></dd>
            <dt>the portion of a wall that extends above the roofline.<hr /></dt>
            <dd><strong>Pedestrian Oriented Development</strong></dd>
            <dt>development designed with an emphasis primarily on the street sidewalk and on pedestrian access to the site and buildings/structures rather than on auto access. The buildings/structures are generally located close to the public or private right-of-way and the main entrance(s) is oriented to the street sidewalk. There are generally windows or display cases along building facades. Although parking is provided, it is generally limited in size and location.<hr /></dt>
            <dd><strong>Pedestrian Walkway</strong></dd>
            <dt>a surfaced walkway, separate from the traveled portion of a public or private right-of-way or parking lot/driving aisle.<hr /></dt>
            <dd><strong>Portico</strong></dd>
            <dt>a porch or walkway with a roof supported by columns, often leading to the entrance to a building.<hr /></dt>
            <dd><strong>Public/Private Right of Way</strong></dd>
            <dt>any public or private road, access easement intended to provide public access to any lot/development, but excluding any service road or internal driving aisles (i.e., within parking lots).<hr /></dt>
            <dd><strong>Screen</strong></dd>
            <dt>see also "buffer". The sole purpose of a screen is to block views. A screen should be constructed of opaque materials and whose height will be effective in obstructing unwanted views.<hr /></dt>
            <dd><strong>Setback</strong></dd>
            <dt>a prescribed distance or an area between one element and another (i.e., a building and the road right-of-way). Within these guidelines, the term also refers to:
                <ul>
                    <li>The minimum distance and the area measured from the property line to the interior of a parcel where buildings may be constructed.</li>
                    <li>The required distance and the area between the edge of the parking lot pavement/curb and the property line or buildings/structures.</li>
                    <li>Placing a building face on a line to the rear of another building line.</li>
                </ul>
            <hr /></dt>
            <dd><strong>Streetscape</strong></dd>
            <dt>all elements of a development or area that are in view from other points along a street.<hr /></dt>

                            <li><strong>INTENT:</strong> Facades should be articulated to reduce the massive scale and the uniform, impersonal appearances of large retail buildings and provide visual interest that will be consistent with the community’s identity character, and scale. The intent is to encourage a more human scale that residents of Georgetown-Scott County will be able to identify with their community. The resulting scale will ensure a greater likelihood of reuse of structure by subsequent tenants.</li>
                            <li><strong>GUIDELINE:</strong> Developments with facade over 100 feet in linear length shall incorporate wall projections or recesses a minimum of 3 foot depth and a minimum of 20 contiguous feet within each 100 feet of facade length and shall extend over 20 percent of the facade. Developments shall use animating features such as arcades, display windows, entry areas, or awnings along at least 60 percent of the facade.</li>

                            <li><strong>INTENT:</strong> The presence of smaller retail stores gives a center a "friendlier" appearance by creating variety, breaking up large expanses, and expanding the range of the site’s activities. Windows and window displays of such stores should be used to contribute to the visual interest of exterior facades. The standards presented in this section are directed toward those situations where additional, smaller stores, with separate, exterior customer entrances are located in the principal buildings or development site.</li>
                            <li><strong>GUIDELINE:</strong> Where principal buildings contain additional, separately owned stores, which occupy less than fifty thousand (50,000) square feet of gross floor area, with separate, exterior customer entrances:

                    <li><strong>Entrances</strong>
                        <ul class="none">
                            <li><strong>INTENT:</strong> Large retail buildings should feature multiple entrances. Multiple building entrances reduce walking distances from cars, facilitate pedestrian and bicycle access from public sidewalks, and provide convenience where certain entrances offer access to individual stores, or identified departments in a store. Multiple entrances also mitigate the effect of the unbroken walls and neglected areas that often characterize building facades that face bordering land uses.</li>
                            <li><strong>GUIDELINE:</strong> All sides of a principal building that directly face an abutting public or private right-of-way shall feature at least one customer entrance. Where a principal building directly faces more than two abutting public or private rights-of-way, this requirement shall apply only to two sides of the building, including the side of the building facing the primary street, and another side of the building facing a secondary street.
                                <br /><br />
The number of entrances for the principal building shall be addressed at the preliminary development plan stage. Where additional stores will be located in the principal building, each such store shall have at least one exterior customer entrance, which shall conform to the above requirements.</li>

                        <ul class="none">
                            <li><strong>INTENT:</strong> Parking areas should provide safe, convenient, and efficient access for vehicles and pedestrians. They should be distributed around large buildings in order to shorten the distance to other buildings and public sidewalks and to reduce the overall scale of the paved surface. If buildings are located closer to streets, the scale of the complex is reduced, pedestrian traffic is encouraged, and architectural details take on added importance.</li>
                            <li><strong>GUIDELINE:</strong> No more than 60 percent of the off-street parking area for the entire property shall be located between the front facade within the front yard of the principal building(s) and the primary abutting street unless the principal building(s) and/or parking lots are screened from view by outlot development (such as restaurants) and additional tree plantings and/or berms.</li>

                    <li><strong>Back and Sides</strong>
                        <ul class="none">
                            <li><strong>INTENT:</strong> The rear or sides of buildings often present an unattractive view of blank walls, loading areas, storage areas, HVAC units, garbage receptacles, and other such features. Architectural and landscaping features should mitigate these impacts. Any back or side of a building visible from a public or private right-of-way shall be built in accordance with Article I. The Planning Commission may waive this requirement as part of the development plan.</li>
                            <li>GUIDELINE: The minimum setback for any building facade shall be in accordance with the B-5 requirements (Zoning Ordinance, Section 4.484, 1- 4). Where the facade faces adjacent residential uses an earthen berm shall be installed, no less than 6 feet in height, containing at a minimum, a double row of evergreen or deciduous trees planted at intervals of 15 feet on center. Additional landscaping may be required by the Planning Commission to effectively buffer adjacent land use as deemed appropriate. All additional landscape requirements of the Landscape Ordinance shall apply.</li>

                        <ul class="none">
                            <li><strong>INTENT:</strong> Loading areas and outdoor storage areas exert visual and noise impacts on surrounding neighborhoods. These areas, when visible from adjoining properties and/or public streets, should be screened, recessed or enclosed. While screens and recesses can effectively mitigate these impacts, the selection of inappropriate screening materials can exacerbate the problem. Appropriate locations for loading and outdoor storage areas include areas between buildings, where more than one building is located on a site and such buildings are not more than 40 feet apart, or on those sides of buildings that do not have customer entrances.</li>

                                    <li>Areas for outdoor storage, truck parking, trash collection or compaction, loading, or other such uses shall not be visible from public or private rights-of-way.</li>
                                    <li>No areas for outdoor storage, trash collection or compaction, loading, or other such uses shall be located within 20 feet of any public or street, public sidewalk, or internal pedestrian way.</li>
                                    <li>Loading docks, truck parking, outdoor storage, utility meters, HVAC equipment, trash dumpsters, trash compaction, and other service functions shall be incorporated into the overall design of the building and the landscaping so that the visual and acoustic impacts of these functions are fully contained and out of view from adjacent properties and public streets, and no attention is attracted to the functions by the use of screening materials that are different from or inferior to the principal materials of the building and landscape.</li>
                                    <li>Non-enclosed areas for the storage and sale of seasonal inventory shall be permanently defined and screened with walls and/or fences. Materials, colors, and designs of screening walls and/or fences and the cover shall conform to those used as predominant materials and colors of the building. If such areas are to be covered, then the covering shall conform to those used as predominant materials and colors on the buildings.</li>
                                    <li>Temporary sales/displays, such as Christmas trees, landscape materials, and fireworks, shall follow all outdoor requirements for B-2, B-4, and B-5 districts as described in the Zoning Ordinance.

                            <li><strong>INTENT:</strong> Pedestrian accessibility opens auto-oriented developments to the neighborhood, thereby reducing traffic impacts and enabling the development to project a friendlier, more inviting image. This section sets forth standards for public sidewalks and internal pedestrian circulation systems that can provide user-friendly pedestrian access as well as pedestrian safety, shelter, and convenience within the center grounds.</li>
                            <li><strong>GUIDELINE:</strong>

                                    <li>Sidewalks at least 6 feet in width shall be provided along all sides of the lot that abut a public or private right-of-way, excluding interstates, Cherry Blossom Way, and McClelland Circle. The Planning Commission may waive this requirement as part of the development plan.</li>
                                    <li>Continuous internal pedestrian walkways, no less than 5 feet in width, shall be provided from the public sidewalk or right-of-way to the principal customer entrance of all principal buildings on the site. At a minimum, walkways shall connect focal points of pedestrian activity such as, but not limited to, transit stops, street crossings, building and store entry points, and shall feature adjoining landscaped areas that include trees, shrubs, benches, flower beds, ground covers, or other such materials for no less than 50 percent of their length.</li>
                                    <li>Sidewalks, no less than 5 feet in width, shall be provided along the full length of the building along any facade featuring a customer entrance, and along any facade abutting public parking areas. Such sidewalks shall be located at least six (6) feet from the facade of the building to provide planting beds for foundation landscaping, except where features such as arcades or entryways are part of the facade.</li>
                                    <li>Internal pedestrian walkways provided in conformance with Subsection b above, shall provide weather protection features such as awnings or arcades within 30 feet of all customer entrances, constructed parallel to the facade of the building. This is not intended to extend into the driving aisles or parking areas.</li>
                                    <li>All internal pedestrian walkways shall be distinguished from driving surfaces through the use of durable, low maintenance surface materials such as pavers, bricks, or scored concrete to enhance pedestrian safety and comfort, as well as the attractiveness of the walkways.

                            <li><strong>INTENT:</strong> Buildings should offer attractive and inviting pedestrian scale features, spaces and amenities. Entrances and parking lots should be configured to be functional and inviting with walkways conveniently tied to logical destinations. Bus stops and drop-off/pick-up points should be considered as integral parts of the configuration. Pedestrian ways should be anchored by special design features such as towers, arcades, porticos, pedestrian light fixtures, bollards, planter walls, and other architectural elements that define circulation ways and outdoor spaces. The features and spaces should enhance the building and the center as integral parts of the community fabric.</li>
                            <li><strong>GUIDELINE:</strong> Each retail establishment subject to these standards shall contribute to the establishment or enhancement of community and public spaces by providing at least two of the following: patio/seating area, pedestrian plaza with benches, transportation center, window shopping walkways, outdoor play area, kiosk area, water feature, clock tower, steeple, or other such deliberately shaped area and/or a focal feature or amenity that, in the judgment of the Planning Commission, adequately enhances such community and public spaces. Any such areas shall have direct access to the public sidewalk network and such features shall not be constructed of materials that are inferior to the principal materials of the building and landscape.
                                <br /><br />
Although Georgetown does not currently maintain a public bus system, areas should be provided or designed to accommodate possible (future) bus service and the growing number of private bus services (i.e., nursing home/assisted living, Housing Authority, Bluegrass Action Council, etc.)</li>

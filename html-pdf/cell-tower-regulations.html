<h4 class="center">AN ORDINANCE RELATED TO THE AMENDMENT OF THE GEORGETOWN/SCOTT COUNTY SUBDIVISION &amp; DEVELOPMENT REGULATIONS REGARDING ARTICLE II (DEFINITIONS) &amp; ARTICLE II, SECTION 2.55 TELECOMMUNICATIONS</h4>

<p><strong>WHEREAS:</strong> By act of the Kentucky Legislature in accordance with HB 270, the Kentucky Revised Statutes (KRS) Chapter 100, the Chapter governing planning and zoning, was amended to provide that local planning units were given the authority to regulate cellular telecommunications towers and related equipment. This act supercedes all previously adopted local requirements, including City of Georgetown Ordinance 98-019 adopted on September 9, 1998; and establishes a uniform application and review process. The Zoning Ordinance must be updated to reflect this act and the adopted revisions.</p>

<p><strong>WHEREAS:</strong> This proposed amendment to the Georgetown-Scott County Zoning Ordinance has been submitted to the citizens through a properly advertised public hearing before the Georgetown-Scott County Planning and Zoning Commission conducted at their July 11, 2002, August 8, 2002, and September 12, 2002, public meeting.

        </ol>
    </li>
    <li>DESIGN STANDARDS: The applicant shall provide information demonstrating compliance with the following requirements. Where the Planning Commission finds that circumstances or conditions relating to the particular application are such that one or more of the requirements listed below are not necessary or desirable for the protection of surrounding property or the public health, safety, and general welfare, and that such special conditions or circumstances make one or more said requirements unreasonable, the Planning Commission, or its duly authorized representative, may modify or waive such requirement, either permanently or on a temporary basis. Any such modification or waiver shall be requested by the applicant, and the applicant shall submit a written justification for each requested modification or waiver.
        <ol class="decimal">

The Planning Commission may allow antennas greater than two hundred (200) feet in height upon review of the applicant's justification that the additional height meets the criteria identified in Subsection K.</li>
            <li>The cellular antenna tower shall be constructed in compliance with the current ANSI/EIA/TIA 222-F standards and other applicable state standards.</li>
            <li>Cellular antenna towers shall not be illuminated, except in accordance with other state or federal regulations.</li>
            <li>The site shall be unstaffed or unmanned. Personnel may periodically visit the site for maintenance, equipment modification, or repairs.

A break in the hedge, not to exceed fifteen (15) feet in width, shall be allowed for access of maintenance personnel and vehicles.</li>
            <li>Surfacing of all driveways and off-street parking areas shall comply with the requirements of the applicable Subdivision &amp; Development Regulations and be at least constructed of gravel or other durable surface.

    </li>
    <li>CRITERIA
        <ol class="decimal">
            <li>Approval or disapproval of the proposal shall be based upon an evaluation of the proposal’s agreement with the Comprehensive Plan, Zoning Ordinance and applicable Subdivision &amp; Development Regulations.</li>
            <li>The Planning Commission may require the applicant to make a reasonable attempt to co-locate additional transmitting or related equipment. The Planning Commission may provide the location of existing cellular antenna towers on which the Commission deems the applicant can successfully co-locate its transmitting and related equipment. If the Planning Commission requires the applicant to attempt co-location, the applicant shall provide the Planning Commission with a statement indicating that the applicant has:
                <ol class="lower-alpha">
                    <li>Successfully attempted to co-locate on towers designed to host multiple wireless service providers' facilities or existing structures such as a telecommunications tower or another suitable structure capable of supporting the applicant's facilities, and that identifies the location of the tower or suitable structure on which the applicant will co-locate its transmission and related facilities; or</li>
                    <li>Unsuccessfully attempted to co-locate on towers designed to host multiple wireless service provider's facilities or existing structures such as a telecommunications tower or another suitable structure capable of supporting the applicant's facilities and that:

                </ol>
            </li>
            <li>The Planning Commission may deny a uniform application to construct a cellular antenna tower based on an applicant's unwillingness to attempt to co-locate additional transmitting or related equipment on any new or existing towers or other structures.</li>
            <li>The Planning Commission shall not regulate the placement of a cellular antenna tower on the basis of the environmental effects of radio frequency emissions to the extent that the proposed facility complies with the regulations of the Federal Communications Commission concerning radio frequency emissions.</li>
        </ol>
    </li>
    <li>AMENDMENTS: Any amendments to plans, except for minor adjustments as determined by the Planning Commission, or its duly authorized representative, and it accordance with the procedures outlined in the Subdivision &amp; Development Regulations, shall be made in accordance with the procedure required by Subsection F, subject to the same limitations and requirements as those under which such plans were originally approved.</li>

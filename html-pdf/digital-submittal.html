<h2 class="center">CITY OF GEORGETOWN ORDINANCE NO. 2003-24</h2>
<h4 class="center">AN ORDINANCE RELATED TO THE AMENDMENT OF THE GEORGETOWN/SCOTT COUNTY SUBDIVISION &amp; DEVELOPMENT REGULATIONS REGARDING ARTICLE V &amp; VII – SPECIFICATIONS FOR DIGITAL SUBMITTALS FOR SUBDIVISION PLATS AND DEVELOPMENT PLANS &amp; REQUIREMENTS FOR CONTENT AND FORMAT</h4>

<p><strong>WHEREAS:</strong> The existing Subdivision &amp; Development Regulations requirements are not satisfying the community’s needs.  The regulation requirements must be updated to reflect the current professional thinking, computerized mapping and best management practices to address continuous updates of the Geographic Information System.  The purpose of these specifications is to form a standardized approach to the way a digital drawing submittal is collected, retrieved, stored and analyzed, affording the Georgetown-Scott County Planning Commission office the ability to share data among multiple agencies and to reduce redundancy.  This new requirement will allow the Geographic Information System (GIS) to be as current as possible, making the information more valuable to all the agencies involved.</p>
<p><strong>WHEREAS:</strong> The Georgetown -Scott County Planning Commission (GSCPC) will require subdivision plats and development plans to be submitted in digital format upon adoption and publication.  This requirement will call for delivery of the digital submittal at the final recording of the plat and certification of the plan.  This requirement is in addition to the existing requirements outlined in the Subdivision and Development Regulations for Georgetown, Sadieville, Stamping Ground, and Scott County, Kentucky .</p>
<p>The intent of a digital submittal requirement is to enable the required hard copy and the digital submission to be produced from the same digital data without any modification by the firms submitting the data or the GSCPC staff.  The digital submittal is not required to have engineering notes or engineering stamp/certification per 201 KAR 18:102 as it relates to KRS 322.340.</p>
<p>A basis of structure is required, such as layer elements and the use of the same geographic/geodetic base by the firms and GSCPC.  However, there are no database linkage requirements.  The digital submittal structure requirements are subject to change.</p>
<p>The hard copy will continue to be the official document.</p>
<p>The intent of this proposed ordinance is to provide an appropriate means to maintain the integrity and accuracy of the existing computerized database and base mapping within the Geographic Information System. </p>
<p><strong>WHEREAS:</strong> This proposed amendment to the Georgetown-Scott County Subdivision &amp; Development Regulations has been submitted to the citizens through a properly advertised public hearing before the Georgetown-Scott County Planning and Zoning Commission conducted at their August 8, 2002, and September 12, 2002, public meeting and re-reviewed at the Commission’s July 10, 2003, public meeting.  The Commission voted unanimously to recommend the adoption of this amendment to the City Council of Georgetown;</p>

<h4>NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL FOR THE CITY OF GEORGETOWN, KENTUCKY, as follows:</h4>

        <h4 class="center">SECTION 720</h4>
        <h4 class="center">CONTENT &amp; FORMAT REQUIREMENTS FOR SUBDIVISION PLATS AND DEVELOPMENT PLANS IN DIGITAL FORM</h4>
        
        <ol class="decimal;">
            <li>PURPOSE: 
                <p>The purpose is to describe the minimum content and format of digital files of subdivision plats and development plans before they are officially filed.  This requirement does not include minor plats and/or boundary line adjustments.</p>
                <p>Submittals of preliminary and construction plans for the subdivision plat or development plan are an optional delivery (requested), but not required.</p>
                <p>This document applies to subdivision plats and development plans that are being officially filed.</p>
            </li>
            <li>SUPPORTED CAD DRAWING FILE FORMATS
                <p>MicroStation&reg; stores its drawing in a design file format with the .DGN extension. The GSCPC will accept files generated by MicroStation&reg;  up to Release MJ.</p>
                <p>AutoCADâ stores its drawing in a proprietary drawing file format with the .DWG extension. The GSCPC will accept files generated by AutoCAD&reg; Release 14 and higher.</p>
                <p>In addition to .DWG files, AutoCAD&reg;  supports DXF (Drawing Interchange file) format, an industry standard interchange file format used to transfer data between CAD and GIS applications. However, when using this format the information put into the drawing may not completely transfer as it was drawn. The GSCPC will accept files generated by AutoCAD&reg; DXF.</p>
                <p>The preferred format for digital submissions to the GIS office will be .DWG.  The GSCPC may waive or adjust this requirement as specified herein.</p>
                <p>File names will be eight or more characters, alpha-numeric, followed by the drawing software's extension.</p>
                <p>The GIS softwares, ArcInfo and ArcView, can read the .DGN, .DWG, and .DXF file formats.</p>
            </li>
            <li>DATA LAYERING &amp; SUBMISSION REQUIREMENTS
                <ol class="lower-alpha;">
                    <li><strong>Data Feature/Layer Requirement:</strong>
                        <ol class="decimal;">
                            <li class="new-language">Parcel Line – required to be snapped at common/shared feature.</li>
                            <li class="new-language">Buildings – required to be “closed” with closed command as performed by AutoCAD or similar software.</li>
                        </ol>
                    </li>
                    <li class="new-language">Annotation Requirement: Annotation submitted digitally will be identical to annotation submitted on the hard copy maps. The section on Data Layering Requirements defines requirements for submission of annotation.</li>
                    <li class="new-language">Coordinates Displayed as Text Requirement: When displaying x and y (and z) coordinates, the whole number for the coordinate will be shown to two (2) decimal positions, i.e., no constants will be applied.</li>
                    <li> The layer names must be identifiable by another person.  For example, layer names created like the following are acceptable mon_pnt, lot_num, drng_area, ex_row, san_lin, swr_txt, wtr_lin.</li>
                    <li>Each layer must have only its element on it.  For example, a water line must be on a water line layer versus the stormwater line or right-of-way line layers.  In addition, with Microstation&reg;, each layer number needs to have a layer name associated with it. Or with other CAD software, the layer names must be identifiable like mon_pnt, lot_num, drng_area, ex_row, san_lin, swr_txt, wtr_lin.</li>
                    <li>All External reference files (xref) must be "bound" into the <span class="stricken">.DWG</span> CAD file prior to submittal <span class="new-language">or included with the submittal.</span></li>
                    <li>Public domain and custom AutoCAD&reg; (.shx) fonts are permitted in the drawing files only if the latest copies of each of these fonts are provided to the Georgetown-Scott County Planning Commission with the submittal of the .DWG file.</li>
                    <li>Text for any layer will be on its own layer.  The layer name is requested to end in "txt."  </li>
                    <li>The following table displays the data features, elements and requirements <span class="stricken">needed</span> <span class="new-language">REQUIRED</span> in a digital submittal.  Additional layers are encouraged.

                <p>Once the digital data is corrected, resubmitted, and verified to be in accordance with the "Specifications for Digital Submittals and Requirements for Content and Format" document through the GSCPC's GIS Office, GSCPC staff will be issued a copy of the plat generated by the digital submittal. GSCPC staff will check it against the hard copy received to verify they coincide, and then proceed with the process of ensuring the information complies with the <em>Subdivision and Development Regulations for Georgetown , Sadieville, Stamping Ground, and Scott County, Kentucky</em> and make a recommendation to the Planning Commission</p>

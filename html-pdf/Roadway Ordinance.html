    <h2>CITY OF GEORGETOWN ORDINANCE NO. 2002-______</h2>
<h3>AN ORDINANCE RELATED TO THE AMENDMENT OF THE GEORGETOWN/SCOTT COUNTY SUBDIVISION &amp; DEVELOPMENT REGULATIONS REGARDING PUBLIC AND PRIVATE ROAD CONSTRUCTION &amp; DESIGN STANDARDS</h3>
      </header>

<p><strong>WHEREAS:</strong> The existing Subdivision &amp; Development Regulations requirements are not satisfying the community’s needs regarding design and construction of roads, right-of-ways and related structures.  The regulation requirements must be updated to reflect the current professional thinking and reduce existing problems with road maintenance and durability by establishing a uniform design standard for proposed public and private roads, including design capacity and loading.  The intent of this proposed ordinance is to provide an appropriate means to maintain the integrity and durability of existing and proposed roads within the community and to reduce the potential negative impacts on the residents of the City of Georgetown and the City Council</p>
<p><strong>WHEREAS:</strong> This proposed amendment to the Georgetown/Scott County Subdivision &amp; Development Regulations has been submitted to the citizens through a properly advertised public hearing before the Georgetown-Scott County Planning and Zoning Commission conducted at their June 12, 2003 and July 10, 2003 public meetings.  The Commission voted unanimously to recommend the adoption of this amendment to the Council for the City of Georgetown.</p>

<p><strong>NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL FOR THE CITY OF GEORGETOWN, KENTUCKY, as follows:</strong></p>

<h4>SECTION ONE: NEW PROVISIONS.</h4>
    <p>[New language is <u><strong>underlined</strong></u>. Language which is unchanged is not marked.  Superseded language is shown as <strike>stricken</strike>.]</p>

<ol class="upper-alpha">
    <li>GENERAL
        <ol class="decimal">
            <li>The provision, arrangement, construction, and phasing of streets shall substantially conform to the Comprehensive Plan, including the Transportation Element in particular.</li>
            <li>No street shall be approved which will be subject to flooding.</li>
            <li>Traffic from higher intensity residential uses shall not pass through lower intensity residential uses, except where the road is classified or designed as a collector or greater. Through traffic shall be discouraged in residential neighborhoods where feasible through techniques such as signage and roadway design and location.</li>
            <li><u> Traffic calming is required for blocks greater than 1000 feet, or as required by Planning Commission Engineer. See AASHTO, LFUCG, FHWA and/or ITE traffic calming documents for acceptable designs.</u>

            <li>Existing street classifications shall be as defined by the Transportation Element of the Comprehensive Plan.</li>
            <li>Each new street (residential and non-residential) shall be designed for its entire length to meet the standards for its classification.</li>
            <li>The applicant may be required to <u>provide a traffic analysis</u> to demonstrate to the Planning Commission's satisfaction that the distribution of traffic to the existing or proposed street system will not exceed the adopted Transportation Element standards for any street.</li>
        </ol>
    </li>
    <!--End B-->
    <li>ROADWAY WIDTHS
        <p>Except for privately owned streets, roadway width standards are shown in exhibit 10-1, and apply to all developments with urban density, with the following exception. For developments in A-1 zones, minimum roadway widths for new roads shall be 18 feet between face of curb or edge of pavement. Shoulders, where needed, shall be 2 feet each side <strike>plus ditches designed by Manning’s formula</strike>  <u>with trapezoidal or parabolic ditches designed per <em>Storm Water Ordinance 2002-026, 2002-07</em> for open channel design.</u>

        </p>
    </li>
    <!--End C-->
    <li>CURBS AND GUTTERS
        <ol class="decimal">
            <li>Curbing is required on all urban streets for the purposes of drainage, safety, and delineation and protection of pavement edge.</li>
            <li>Curbing shall be designed to provide ramps for wheelchairs at all street intersections with sidewalks with a minimum of one for every corner, and as required by state law.</li>
            <li><u>Curbs and gutters are to be built to the following specifications:
                <ol class="lower-alpha">
                    <li>Construct all curb and gutter on a prepared subgrade to the dimensions and design as in the approved construction plans and/or standard drawings.</li>
                    <li>All Concrete shall have class “A” specifications.</li>
                    <li>Sawed contraction joints shall be constructed every 20 feet with a minimum depth of 3 inches in accordance with the <em>Kentucky Department of Highways Standard Specifications, Current Edition</em>.</li>
                    <li>Expansion joints shall be constructed at all breaks in alignment, at contact with new or existing concrete, at all drainage inlets, at the beginning and ending points of curves, and not to exceed 200’ maximum spacing for slip form application and 30’ maximum spacing for hand placed.</li>
                    <li>Maintain concrete at a minimum temperature of 45 degrees Fahrenheit for 3 calendar days after placement and at a minimum temperature of 40 degrees Fahrenheit for an additional 4 calendar days.  When the Planning Commission Engineer requires, submit a written outline of the method to be used for protecting concrete.  The Planning Commission Engineer, and or Development Inspector reserve the right to discontinue concrete placement when the means of protection or method of placement does not produce satisfactory results.  Do not place concrete during times of the year that the temperatures may be expected to drop below the 45 or 40 degrees Fahrenheit limits, unless there are adequate provisions at the job site for maintaining concrete at the specified temperature.</li>
                    <li>Immediately after completing finishing operations and the concrete has set sufficiently to prevent marring the surface, cure the entire surface of the newly placed concrete, including the face of all construction joints.  Cure according to one of the following methods:
                        <ol class="lower-roman">
                            <li><em>White Membrane Curing</em>: (Type 2, Class “A” or “B”) Ensure that all curing compounds conform to AASHTO M 148.</li>
                            <li><em>Wet Burlap</em>:  Thoroughly wet the burlap before placing.  Carefully place the burlap over the finished surface to completely cover the surface and sides of the slab.  Clean the burlap of all coating of earth or other deleterious substances before using it.  Soak new burlap in water for 12 hours before using.  During the first six hours a single thickness of burlap will be required.  After the first six hours, use a double thickness.  Overlap adjacent burlap strips at least 3 inches.  Keep the burlap thoroughly saturated and in place for at least 72 hours even when required strength is attained.</li>
                            <li><em>Curing Blankets</em>: Keep the concrete continuously damp for the period of time specified for the item being constructed, beginning immediately after placing and finishing.  As soon as possible, without damaging the concrete surface, moisten the concrete by applying water, and immediately cover the surface with the curing blankets.  Place the blankets so that the adjoining blankets overlap at least 18 inches.  Weight all laps and outside edges to prevent displacement of the blankets before completing curing.  Ensure intimate contact between the blankets and the concrete surface.  Use curing blankets that consist of a top layer of white copolymer material and a bottom layer of absorbent, non-woven, synthetic fabric.  Ensure that the layers are securely bonded together so there will be no separation of the layers during handling and curing of the concrete.  When tested according to AASHTO M 171, ensure that moisture loss does not exceed 0.010 grams per square centimeter and that reflectance is at least 70 percent.</li>
                            <li><em>Wet Curing</em>: Cure concrete for a period of at least 7 calendar days, beginning immediately after placement and finishing, by frequently applying water to all surfaces to keep them continuously damp during the full 7-calendar day curing period or until the required strength is attained.  Protect exposed concrete surfaces from drying by application of a double thickness of wet burlap or similar approved material and keep the burlap or other approved material continuously wet for a period of 7 or more days.  Soak new burlap in water for at least 12 hours before the first use.</li>

        <li>In all urban subdivisions or subdivisions with urban densities (lot sizes of up to 1.0 acre or provide for densities greater than 1 dwelling unit per acre), sidewalks shall be installed on both sides of all proposed roads, public or private. Sidewalks shall be extended around the full length of any cul-de-sac or other approved turn-around.  Sidewalks shall be placed in the right-of-way, parallel to the street, unless an exception has been permitted to preserve historically significant, topographical or natural features or to provide visual interest, or unless the applicant shows that an alternative pedestrian system provides safe and convenient circulation.  The Planning Commission may waive this requirement and permit the installation of the sidewalk on only one side with the location to be reviewed and approved by the Planning Director and/or Planning Commission Engineer.  The Planning Commission may permit an exception to allow sidewalks to abut the curb where the intent is to create an urban atmosphere in townhouse, or similar, development and in neighborhood or downtown business zones, if the arrangement ensures pedestrian safety (amended per ordinance 2000-016).</li>
        <li>Pedestrian-way easements ten (10) feet wide may be required by the Planning Commission where reasonably needed to provide circulation or access to schools, parks, shopping, or other community facilities.</li>
        <li>Sidewalks and pedestrian ways shall be constructed according to the specifications set forth in Appendix VII <u>and the following specifications</u>:

In existing  neighborhoods, expansion material shall be placed at the beginning and end of newly constructed areas (sidewalk/curb and gutter with grass utility strip). When the sidewalk is constructed integral with the curb, ensure that the width and spacing of the joints conform to that in the curb.  Round the edges of the sidewalk at all expansion joints with an approved edging tool to a ¼ inch radius.  Install ½ inch premolded expansion joint material to the full depth of the sidewalk where the sidewalk abuts any rigid structure or fixture, such as curbs, columns, castings, buildings, and light standards. </li>
                    <li>Divide the surfaces of sidewalks into rectangular areas by means of a jointer having a radius of ¼ inch and forming a groove no less than one inch in depth for the full width of the walk.  Ensure that the length of the rectangles formed does not exceed the width to the sidewalk being constructed.  Sawed joints will need to be completed no later than one day following the end of the curing period. </li>
                    <li>The sidewalks shall be placed adjacent to the street right-of-way line.  Slope toward curb shall be one quarter ( ¼) of an inch to the foot.  Construction in existing neighborhoods requires the contractor to match existing grade and sidewalk width unless specified otherwise by the Planning Commission Engineer.  Distance will vary with road cross-section when conforming to detail of (sidewalk/curb and gutter with grass utility strip).</li>

                        <li>Subgrade areas for all proposed roadways are to be thoroughly compacted to the specifications listed in this article and the approved construction drawings.</li>
                        <li>No organic material to be permitted in any roadway subgrade.</li>
                        <li>All roadway subgrades are to have California Bearing Ratio (CBR) tests performed. Tests are to be representative of the site.</li>
                        <li>Compact the subgrade and embankments to a density of at least 95 percent of standard proctor.  During compaction, maintain the moisture content of embankment or subgrade material within ± 2 percent of the optimum moisture content.  Compact each lift as required before depositing for the next lift.  Soil is to be compacted in lifts not exceeding one foot unless directed otherwise by the design engineer.</li>
                        <li>The cross slope of the proposed subgrade is to be ¼ inch per foot fall, except in cases of superelevated crowns.</li>
                        <li>Finished subgrades must be proof rolled with a loaded 20 ton vehicle, minimum. All lanes and cul-de-sac areas are to be rolled tested. Proof roll test is only applicable prior to any increase in moisture content due to weather conditions or other water-related circumstances, for example, rain, snow, waterline breaks, groundwater intrusion, etc.</li>
                        <li>If pumping or rutting of the subgrade occurs, then the noted area is to be remediated by one of the following means:

                               <li>Synthetic: geotextiles.</li>
                               <li>Mechanical: replacing unacceptable material with #2 stone (open graded material is to be separated with KYTC Type II fabric from the subgrade and drained off). The minimum layer thickness shall be 8 inches of #2 stone.</li>
                               <li>Chemical: lime stabilization, etc.</li>
                               <li>Reworking existing material: if material ruts during proof roll then this method is unacceptable; also after material is reworked it is subject to another proof roll test.</li>
                           </ol>
                        </li>

                        <li>Base material for all proposed roadways is to be either Dense Graded Aggregated or Crushed Stone Base (DGA/CSB, as defined by the Kentucky Transportation Cabinet (KYTC).</li>
                        <li>Each lift of DGA base material is not to exceed 6” maximum.  After each subsequent lift string line will be pulled to check for proper depth and cross slope (1/4 inch per foot fall).  Each lift will also require a check of the density and moisture content.  The density shall be 84% of solid volume, or 140 lbs. per cubic foot.  The acceptable moisture content range shall be from 3% to 5%.</li>
                        <li>Before constructing a CSB base, complete a control strip to determine the level of compaction necessary to achieve the target density for the remaining base course.  Construct additional control strips whenever a change is made in the source, gradation, type of subgrade, type of base aggregate, or layer thickness. Leave each control strip in place to become part of the project.  Complete at least one control strip for each layer of base material.  Construct a control strip a minimum length of 500 feet and to the full width of the aggregate base course.  Use the same equipment and procedures intended for the construction of the remainder of the base course.  After two passes the Development Inspector will require (3) density measurements at randomly selected sites, at least two feet from the edge of the base.  The Development Inspector will require density measurements at the same (3) locations after subsequent passes of the compaction equipment.  Compact the control strip until no further increase in density can be obtained from additional passes. The inspector will visually inspect the material after each pass to determine if the aggregate is being crushed into fine material.  If the aggregate is being crushed, cracked, shoved, or shows other signs of distress, cease compaction efforts.  If compaction of the base is not satisfactory, use other methods to achieve satisfactory results. After completing compaction of the control strip, the Development Inspector will require 10 field density measurements at random locations in the control strip and require the averaging of the 10 measurements to obtain the target density for the compaction of the base.  Once the target density is obtained the remaining base course, equal to that same depth of the control strip, will be checked by nuclear gage at various locations.  The density of these test sections shall average 98 percent of the target density or greater with no individual measurement less than 95 percent of the target density. When the average density of a test section does not meet the required density, cease laydown operations, and either provide additional compaction effort or rework the material to obtain the required average density.  Do not add fines to meet the target density.</li>
                        <li>Density tests cannot be performed on any base layers that have standing water on them.</li>
                        <li>During times of the year where base moisture is a concern, the designer can substitute the bottom 4 inch base layer with a 7 inch layer of #2 stone. This layer must be separated from the subgrade with KYTC Type II fabric and drained off (this layer cannot be applied toward any subgrade remediation).</li>

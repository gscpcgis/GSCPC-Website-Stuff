    <h2>CITY OF GEORGETOWN ORDINANCE NO. 2003-__</h2>
    <h3>AN ORDINANCE RELATED TO THE AMENDMENT OF THE GEORGETOWN/SCOTT COUNTY SUBDIVISION &amp; DEVELOPMENT REGULATIONS REGARDING ARTICLE XII &amp; APPENDIX III– ENVIRONMENTALLY SENSITIVE AREAS</h3>
</header>

<p><strong>WHEREAS</strong>: The existing Subdivision &amp; Development Regulations requirements are not satisfying the community’s needs.  In order to provide for the safe and orderly development of property, the maintenance of property values, and the delivery of governmental services for the public’s protection and safety, it is necessary to maintain the planning and zoning process with periodic amendments in response to new and existing challenges.  The regulation requirements must be updated to reflect the current professional thinking, engineering principles and best management practices to address environmentally sensitive areas and sinkhole areas.  Georgetown and Scott County contain numerous environmentally sensitive areas, including sinkhole related areas that must be addressed during the development process. </p>
<p>All new developments, including those that require substantial renovations or expansions, within the urbanized area will be required to adhere to the new requirements regarding environmentally sensitive areas.  Every time that a piece of land is developed, certain and expected changes occur.  Changes potentially to the surface and sub-surface areas can be impacted.  The new regulations hope to reduce and offset those issues.</p> 
<p>The intent of this proposed ordinance is to provide an appropriate means to maintain and protect the integrity of environmentally sensitive areas within our neighborhoods and the City of Georgetown ;</p>
<p><strong>WHEREAS:</strong> This proposed amendment to the Georgetown-Scott County Subdivision &amp; Development Regulations has been submitted to the citizens through a properly advertised public hearing before the Georgetown-Scott County Planning and Zoning Commission conducted at their July 10, 2003, August 14, 2003, and September 11, 2003, public meeting.  The Commission voted unanimously to recommend the adoption of this amendment to the City Council of Georgetown;</p>

<p><strong>NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL FOR THE CITY OF GEORGETOWN, KENTUCKY, as follows:</strong></p>

<h4>SECTION ONE: NEW PROVISIONS.</h4> 
<p>[Superseded language is shown as <strike>stricken</strike>.  All other language is new]</p>

<ul class="none">
    <li><strike>G.  MULTIPLE ENVIRONMENTALLY SENSTIVE AREAS
        <p>During conceptual or preliminary plan or plan review, the Planning Commission staff shall advise the developer of areas with a concentration of environmentally sensitive resources or areas prone to hazards to human health and safety, and the Planning Commission shall based upon findings of fact regarding these areas, require analysis and implementation of measures to mitigate impacts of development.  Examples include concentrations of sinkholes, cave areas, major rock formations, and extremely steep slopes.</p></strike>
    </li>
    <li>G.     ENVIRONMENTALLY SENSITIVE AREAS
        <p>Environmentally sensitive areas are defined as those features located on a property including sinkholes, cave areas, major rock formations and outcroppings, springs, floodplains/floodways, landfills/refuse areas,.  Properties proposed for development that include environmentally sensitive areas are encouraged to “design around” those areas and designate them as “non-buildable” whenever possible in order to mitigate any potential negative impacts on the area or within the development. </p>
        <p>Due to the nature of portions of Georgetown and Scott County , including Stamping Ground and Sadieville, steep slope areas are referenced here but not formally included within the definition of an environmentally sensitive area.  For areas with existing steep slopes (i.e., those exceeding 10 percent), those areas shall be shown on the zone change application/concept plan or master plan, preliminary development plan or subdivision plat approval, and required construction plans, as noted below.  Existing steep slope areas include those areas greater than 100’ in length and width. </p>
        <p>Applicants for development proposals and/or their representatives shall provide the Planning Commission staff with information regarding environmentally sensitive areas and existing steep slope areas as follows:</p>
        <ol class="lower-alpha">
            <li>(recommended) <u>zone change application/concept plan or master plan approval</u>, including a map showing the specific location of the of the environmentally sensitive feature and/or existing steep slope areas.</li>
            <li>(required) <u>preliminary development plan or subdivision plat approval</u>. The information shall include at a minimum a map showing the specific location of the environmentally sensitive feature and/or existing steep slope areas that will be further studied and examined. For existing steep slopes, the map shall include the slope of the property at 100’ intervals across the slope; the Planning Commission Engineer may require intervals less than 100’ if deemed necessary.</li>
            <li>(required) <u>construction plan approval</u>. The information shall include specific location and extent or boundary(s) of the environmentally sensitive feature and/or existing steep slope areas, method used to determine the extent or boundary(s) of the feature and proposed remediation, if applicable. Additional information regarding protective measures during construction, as applicable, shall be included as part of the construction plans. 
                <ol class="lower-roman">
                    <li>Examination of sinkholes, springs and other similar features shall be completed by a licensed geo-technical engineer.  The Planning Commission shall require the geo-technical engineer to submit a complete report of the findings, proposed remediation and verification of remediation (i.e., certification of inspection of the remediation materials and construction standards).  Two (2) copies of the analysis and study, including any remediation methods shall be submitted to the Planning Commission Engineer for review and recordkeeping.  Verification and certification of any remediation methods is required prior to final development plan or subdivision plat approval.</li><!--G.c.i-->
                </ol>
            </li><!--End of G.c-->
            <li>(required) <u>final development plan or subdivision plat approval</u>.  Environmentally sensitive areas shall be shown on the final development plan or final subdivision plat.  Existing steep slope areas must be shown or referenced on the final development plan or final subdivision plat, if required by the Planning Commission or Planning Commission Engineer.  For sinkholes and other similar features the final development plan or final subdivision plat shall include approval and signature of Appendix III – Form M Sinkhole Certification by the geo-technical engineer who performed the analysis of the area.  A note shall be placed on the final development plan or subdivision plat indicating these areas, referencing the required study, including the date performed.</li>
        </ol><!--End of G.a-d-->
        <p>For areas with a sinkhole, multiple sinkholes and/or a sinkhole cluster, the following requirements shall apply: </p>
        <p>Definitions:</p>
        <dl>
            <dt>Sinkhole</dt>
            <dd>any closed depression formed by removal (typically underground) of water, surficial soil, rock, or other material.  The existing of a sinkhole shall be as indicated by the closed depression contour line(s) as shown on the USGS, KGS, GSCPC-GIS Section mapping or other documents as approved by the Planning Commission Engineer and/or City Engineer, as applicable.  The actual limits may however be determined by field measurements with concurrence of the Planning Commission Engineer and/or City Engineer.  Sinkholes may be either circular in plan or irregular, depending upon structural control.</dd>
            <dt>Immediate Sinkhole Drainage Area</dt>
            <dd>any area that contributes surface water directly to the sinkhole(s) not including areas which contribute surface water indirectly to a sinkhole (via streams or other means).</dd>
            <dt>Sinkhole Cluster Area</dt>
            <dd>Any area that contributes surface water other than by way of a stream to a sinkhole that is located in a group of two or more sinkholes clustering together or in a line.</dd>
        </dl>
        <p>Sinkholes are natural depressions which drain a significant portion of the mid- to lower areas of Scott County, including the City of Georgetown and Stamping Ground. Sinkholes and sinkhole systems are part of a complex drainage system that is tied to caves, springs and underground streams.  Flooding, subsidence and water pollution are the major problems associated with sinkhole area developments.  Those problems are generally illustrated in Exhibit 1 (source: Development Impacts in Sinkhole Areas – Knoxville/Knox County Metropolitan Planning Commission, May 1995).</p>
        <p>Requirements:</p>
